# jwt-decoder

A simple webpage to decode JSON Web Tokens. There are many web token sites out there, but a JWT is a password. It's not a good idea to paste a password in some random website. This site is very slimed down and runs with few dependencies. The intent is for you to copy this site and host it on your own infrastructure that you trust.
